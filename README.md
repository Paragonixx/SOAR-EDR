# SOAR EDR

## Objective

The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Designing a playbook workflow
- Drawing out how I want the playbook to work
- How to make a playbook (story) that integrates slack, email and response capabilities -How to build a custom detection & response rule using LimaCharlie
- How to generate events using a password recovery tool 
- Automation , where I started creating my playbook/story in tines 
- Advanced understanding of SOAR concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize events
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Windows virtual machine in the cloud (Vultr) as my agent
- LimaCharlie acting as my Endpoint Detection & Response EDR tool 
- Tines acting as my SOAR 
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
